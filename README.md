## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a co-localization method for identifying and analyzing the co-localization. A basic usecase and related documentation will be added soon.

> **Note:** A paper detailing the algorithm and theoretical underpinnings of this approach will also be available soon. Please stay tuned for updates!
