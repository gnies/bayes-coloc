## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a co-localization method for identifying and analyzing the co-localization. The approach leverages Bayesian inference to improve precision and robustness in detecting true object associations and to quantify uncertainties in co-localization.

> **Note:** A paper detailing the algorithm and theoretical underpinnings of this approach will be available soon. Please stay tuned for updates!
